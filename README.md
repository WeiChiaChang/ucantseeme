This is pretty serious stuff, here's a demo！ And you can also play the live example on CodePen.

## 🚨 Caveat
At this stage, you have to use <b>Google Chrome</b> (version >  60 at least) for browsing since Web Speech API is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and other browsers still under implementation so far. You can check [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition) for more details.

## 🤔 How to Use
Installation

```shell
$ npm install ucantseeme
```

Usage

import ucantseeme from 'ucantseeme'

Make sure to open your <b>Allow</b> site's usage of microphone :
