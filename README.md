> 👊 YOU CAN'T SEE ME

Watch out, here's the greatest npm package that helps you see John Cena in you screen. This is pretty serious stuff with **special sounds effect** by saying **"John Cena"** this keyword.

## 🚨 Caveat
At this stage, you have to use **Google Chrome** (version >  60 at least) for browsing since Web Speech API is an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and other browsers still under implementation so far. You can check [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition) for more details.

## 🤔 How to Use
Installation

```shell
$ npm install ucantseeme
```

Usage

```javascript
import ucantseeme from 'ucantseeme'
```

Make sure to open your **Allow** site's usage of microphone :
